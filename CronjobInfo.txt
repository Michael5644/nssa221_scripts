Crontab location: /var/spool/cron/<username>
The file is created only after the user creates their first cron job.

Crontab file format (* * * * * <file location>):
<minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week> <command/message-in-quotes/executable in a file location>

Note: <hour> is in the 24-hour format. 8 AM is 8, while 8 PM would be 20.

Example: 30 08 10 06 * /home/backups/full-backup.sh
Runs the shell script “full-backup.sh” on June 10th (10, 06); at 8:30 AM (30, 08); on every day of the week (*)

Leaving a section as a * means it will be run on every (unit) on that specific slot

Example 2: 00 11, 16 * * * /home/bin/incremental-backup.py
Runs the python script "incremental-backup.py" on every day, every month, and on every day of the week (* * *); at 11:00 AM and 4:00 PM (00 11, 16)
00 is the 0th minute. 59 would be 59th minute, etc.

To add an entry to the crontab file use the crontab –e command as the current user. 
The user that creates the job must also be the same user that is the owner of the script.

Don't edit /etc/crontab directly via nano, vim, etc. Always use the crontab utilities:
crontab –l     lists the user’s crontab. 
crontab –e     edits the user’s crontab. 
crontab –r     deletes the user’s crontab. 


Cronjob entry example:
Rocky client:

crontab -e
* * * * * logger "CRON TEST MESSAGE"
Save and exit.

Rocky log server (ANOTHER ROCKY VM):
- Displays the messages in /var/log/messages

To find the messages, use: tail –f /var/log/messages | grep <keyword in the crontab you sent from client>


CONNECTING THE TWO ROCKY VMs TOGETHER:
On the rocky log server (not client):
1. Login as root
2. nano /etc/rsyslog.conf (or /etc//resyslog.conf if you don't find the content in the first one)
3. Uncomment or add the following block in the configuration file:
    module(load=”imudp”) # needs to be done just once 
    input(type=”imudp” port=”514”)
    module(load=”imtcp”) # needs to be done just once 
    input(type=”imtcp” port=”514”)

4. Save and exit
5. Create a firewall rule to allow traffic through the port rsyslog is listening on, which is port 514. Also enable TCP and UDP.
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/udp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/tcp
    firewall-cmd --reload

6. Restart rsyslog: systemctl restart rsyslog


On the rocky client:
1. nano /etc/rsyslog.conf
2. Add this line to the end of the file: *.* @@<server IP Address or hostname>:514 
3. Restart rsyslog: systemctl restart rsyslog

Verify:
1. On the log server, start watching logs: tail -f /var/log/messages
2. On the client, send a test message: logger "Sending Test Message"
3. If it appears in the log server, good.
4. Proceed to run a cronjob. (View entry example above for the instructions.)
