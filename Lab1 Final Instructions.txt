DNS addresses (For the COMPUTER, NOT DHCP DNS! (Only 8.8.8.8 as the secondary DHCP DNS. Primary DHCP DNS would be the web server's IP)):
	127.0.0.1
	8.8.8.8

Lab 1 commands:
	Rocky Linux (Change hostname): sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>.<rit-username>.com
	Windows (Change hostname): Rename-Computer -NewName <hostname> -Restart

GitHub install (web server): winget install Git.Git
	Open new powershell window after download complete. Use git --version to check.
	git clone https://github.com/Michael5644/nssa221_scripts
	cd into the repository.

On Rocky Linux: sudo dnf install -y git
	Verify via git --version
	Navigate to the directory you want the repo in
	Clone with: git pull https://github.com/Michael5644/nssa221_scripts.git (MUST INCLUDE .git AT THE END)
	Enter the repo with cd, git pull to update it

PFsense (Get a linked clone):
1. Configure NIC (VM settings) and get a total of 2 adapters
	Adapter 1 is WAN (NAT). Nothing needs to be done after.

	Adapter 2 is LAN (LAN). Add LAN segment and select it.

	Record each mac addresses on the adapters.

2. In the pfsense terminal: Select 1: Assign interface -> No to VLANS -> set WAN to the mac address of the NAT, and set LAN to the mac address of the LAN.

3. Set LAN IP: Select 2: Set interface(s) IP address -> set LAN (Static) -> No to configure via DHCP -> assign static address as specified (Example: 192.168.1.1/24)
	Press enter to skip upstream gateway.
	No to IPv6 via DHCP
	Do not enable DHCP on LAN. 
	Skip IPv6. 
	Yes to HTTP.


Windows Server (Get a linked clone):
1. Turn NAT into LAN, attach the same LAN segment, log in as student (password: student)	
	In the web server search bar, search 'View network connection'
	Choose the required connection -> properties
	Select internet protocal version 4 -> properties
	Click 'use the following', set a static IPv4 configuration according to instructions.
	Gateway IP is your pfSense LAN IP.
	(/24 means 255.255.255.0)
	Windows (Change hostname): Rename-Computer -NewName <hostname> -Restart

	
2. Ping to verify connectivity. (Ping pfsense LAN IP, or http://<pfsense LAN IP> in web server
	(Fun fact command, use in powershell ADMIN): To enable DHCP via command, do Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceAlias <adapter name here> -Dhcp Enabled
	
	To get the adapter name, do Get-NetAdapter

	DHCP command for DNS: Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ResetServerAddresses


Rocky Linux (Get linked clone):
1. Turn NAT in LAN, attach same LAN segment.

2. Set hostname with FQDN. (<hostname>.<rit-username>.com, or whatever the instructions specify.)
	sudo su - (or just sudo if doesn't work)
	hostnamectl set-hostname <the FQDN for the system>
	hostnamectl to check.

3. Assign static IPv4 with nmcli. Steps:
	nmcli connection edit <ens-number> (find the ens# with 'ip addr' in the terminal)
	set ipv4.addresses <ip specified by task> (example: <192.168.1.3/24>)
		Say yes to manual
	set ipv4.gateway <pfSence LAN ip>
	set ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
	save
	quit
	nmcli

	Reboot nmcli. Do:
	nmcli connection down <ens-number>
	nmcli connection up <ens-number>


Windows 11 Client (Get linked clone):
1. Turn NAT into LAN, attach the same LAN segment.

2. Rename computer in Powershell admin with: Rename-Computer -NewName <hostname> -Restart (ONLY the hostname. Not the entire FQDN.)

3. Using Powershell Admin:
	Get-NetAdapter, find the Interface Index #

	New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex <#> `
	-IPAddress <Whatever IP instructions say> `
	-PrefixLength <Whatever task says> `
	-DefaultGateway <pfSense LAN IP>

	Set-DnsClientServerAddress `
	-InterfaceIndex <#> `
	-ServerAddresses (<Whatever task says>) -- Example: ("192.168.1.2", "8.8.8.8") # Primary DNS is web server's IP!! Required!!
