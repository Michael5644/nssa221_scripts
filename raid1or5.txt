RAID 1: 
Create a new rocky linux VM, add in 2 additional hard disk drives. 
NVMe -> create a new virtual disk -> set to 4 GB each -> name them storage0, 1, so on -> put as same folder as the linked clone.

1. lsblk, then: Using the mkfs command format the first drive that you added to the virtual machine. Caution: NOT the system drive, which contains the boot partition, referring to Figure 4 that would be nvme0n1. More than likely the first newly added drive will be nvme0n2.
2. Format command: mkfs.xfs /dev/nvme0n2
3. Create the directory /media/samba, this will be used to mount the newly reformatted drive. Mount command: mount <device> <mount point>
4. mount /dev/nvme0n2 /media/samba, then df -h to verify

5. By convention /dev/md0 (multiple disk 0) is use to identify the first RAID, the second will be /dev/md1, and so on. 
- Additional information you will need is the RAID “level” and the number of devices. 
- Use two unused drives, assuming that the system drive is nvme0n1, and the drive you mounted in Activity 2 was nvme0n2, the next two available drives are nvme0n3, and nvme0n4. 

6. Create RAID 1 array: mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/nvme0n3 /dev/nvme0n4
7. Verify raid via 'cat /proc/mdstat'
8. Partition RAID device via 'fdisk /dev/md0'
9. First partition: m -> o (MBR/DOS partition table) -> n -> p/e (primary/extended, choose one) -> Press Enter (Defaults to partition #1) -> Press Enter (Defaults to First sector)
-> +1G (Sets Partition 1 to 1GB, and primary)
10. Second partition: n -> e (extended) -> Enter (Defaults to next available) -> Enter -> Enter (Uses all remaining space)
11. Third partition: n (Auto logical partition, primary and extended are used up) -> Enter -> Enter
12 At the prompt, type 'w' to writes the 3 to disk, and exits fdisk
13. 'ls /dev | grep md0' to verify. p1 is primary, p2 is extended, p5 is logical
14. Format the primary and logical partitions using a file system: mkfs.xfs /dev/md0p1 | mkfs.xfs /dev/md0p5
15. Create two directories /media/nfs1 and /media/nfs2 and mount the partition to them.
- mount /dev/md0p1 /media/nfs1   |   mount /dev/md0p5 /media/nfs2


RAID 5:
Create a new rocky linux VM, add in 3 additional hard disk drives. 
NVMe -> create a new virtual disk -> set to 4 GB each -> name them storage0, 1, so on -> put as same folder as the linked clone.

1. Create RAID 5 array: mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/nvme0n5 /dev/nvme0n6 /dev/nvme0n7
2. Verify raid via 'cat /proc/mdstat'
3. Partition RAID device via 'gdisk /dev/md1'
4. First partition: m -> o (Confirm when prompted) -> n -> Enter -> Enter -> +2G -> Enter
5. Second partition: n -> Enter -> Enter -> +2G -> Enter
6. Third partition: n -> Enter -> Enter -> +2G -> Enter
7. w -> y
8. Format all 3: mkfs.xfs /dev/md1p1; mkfs.xfs /dev/md1p2; mkfs.xfs /dev/md1p3
9. 'ls /dev | grep md1' to confirm
10. Create the directories /media/samba1, /media/samba2 and /media/samba3 and mount the partitions.
- mount /dev/md1p1 /media/samba1   |   mount /dev/md1p2 /media/samba2   |   mount /dev/md1p3 /media/samba3


Persistent mount:
1. To mount on boot, you will need to place an entry in the /etc/fstab file (nano /etc/fstab).
2. Find UUID via 'blkid'. Look for the the drive you mounted (/dev/nvme0n2) and the 5 mounts you did.
3. Copy them and paste into /etc/fstab file, following the format of the LINES NOT IN COMMENTS. (Format: <UUID> <mount-location> <xfs (or any other format)> defaults 0 0)
4. Save and exit. Test via 'mount -a'. If no errors, it works. Finally, verify via 'mount | grep media'.
